# Introduction

This is a test document to demonstrate image orientation handling in Markdown. The following images demonstrate both landscape and portrait orientations with proper attributes and captions.

## Landscape Image Example

![This is a landscape-oriented image showing a wide panoramic view. Landscape images are typically wider than they are tall, with an aspect ratio greater than 1:1.](/path/to/landscape-image.png){#fig:landscape orientation="landscape"}

## Portrait Image Example

![This is a portrait-oriented image showing a vertical composition. Portrait images are typically taller than they are wide, with an aspect ratio less than 1:1.](/path/to/portrait-image.png){#fig:portrait orientation="portrait"}

Both images above include proper orientation attributes that can be used by rendering tools to determine how to display them correctly in the final document.
